//  This class uses our standard shared-pointer architecture.
//
//  1. The constructor does not perform any initialization; it just sets all
//     attributes to their defaults.
//
//  2. All initialization takes place via init methods, which can fail if an
//     object is initialized more than once.
//
//  3. All allocation takes place via static constructors which return a shared
//     pointer.
//
//  Note, however, that it is never safe to put this particular object on the
//  stack. therefore, everything except for the static constructors are private.
